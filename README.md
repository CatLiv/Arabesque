Some Geometric Art Figures

Early 2018, I started to draw (manually!) some geometric figures, mainly based on Islamic Art (see my artworks here : https://www.instagram.com/explore/tags/CL_arabesque/?hl=en). 

On summer 2018, I decided to come back to some SW dev (I used to code yeaaaaaaaaaaaaars agooooooo in C/C++) and to learn Python. Then, as 1st projects, I decided to code ... my artworks. Et voil√† le travail !
