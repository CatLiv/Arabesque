# Arabesque
Some Geometric Art Figures

Early 2018, I started to draw (manually!) some geometric figures, mainly based on Islamic Art (see my artworks here : https://www.instagram.com/explore/tags/CL_arabesque/?hl=en). 

On summer 2018, I decided to come back to some SW dev (I used to code yeaaaaaaaaaaaaars agooooooo in C/C++) and to learn Python. Then, as 1st projects, I decided to code ... my artworks. Et voil√† le travail !

Lessons learnt :
- For whatever question, www.stackoverflow.com is your best friend
- For Arabesque, Python module Turtle https://docs.python.org/2/library/turtle.html is also your best friend
- IPE PyCharm https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download/#section=windows for Python development is ... a charm ! 
- Some figures coding are from me, I also gathered here figures I found interesting and put the source URL link in the .py file
